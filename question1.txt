write a blog on difference between HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2

HTTP 1.1
==>first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997.First version is 1.1 and this version is still in use on web.
==>It is slow.
==>MULTIPLEXING:It loads resourses,one after other, so if one resourse cannot be loaded,it blocks all other resources behindit.
==>SERVER PUSH:A server only serves content to a client device,if the client asks for it.
==>HEADER COMPRESSION:small files load more quickly than large one.

HTTP 2
==>In 2015,a new version HTTP2 was created.
==>It is much faster and more efficient than HTTP1.1
==>MULTIPLEXING:It is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once,no other resources blocks any other resources.
==>SERVER PUSH:In HTTP2 solves a HTTP1.1 problem,by a server to "PUSH" content to a client device before client ask for it.
==> HEADER COMPRESSION: In this,uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK. This method resulting in faster loading.
